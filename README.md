![Screenshot from 2025-03-12 15-08-02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/035f813d-ae27-441e-9424-b9e6ad71ba21)


A countdown timer application designed for special contests, featuring two separate timers: a right timer and a left timer. This application allows users to set timers for different phases of the contest, ensuring a smooth and organized experience.

## Features

- **Dual Timers**: Users can set timers for both the right and left sections.
- **Five Phases**: Each timer has five distinct phases:
  - طرح مسله (Problem Statement)
  - دفاع اول (First Defense)
  - دفاع دوم (Second Defense)
  - دفاع سوم (Third Defense)
  - دفاع چهارم (Fourth Defense)
- **Sound Notification**: When a timer reaches zero, a sound notification alerts participants that the time is up.
- **Timer Storage**: Users can store their timer settings for each phase.

## Current Limitations

This project is still under development and has some known issues:

- **Timer Storage**: The functionality for storing timer settings is not working perfectly. Users may experience issues with saving and retrieving timer values.
- **Sound Notification**: The sound alert feature to notify users when the timer reaches zero has not been implemented yet.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For the core functionality of the countdown timers.
- **HTML**: For the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application (if applicable).
